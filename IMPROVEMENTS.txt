1. Ask chatGPT for better words to instruct user on app usage in workstation.html. DONE
2. chatGPT says I need to fix query logic in add_song route, specifically in the IS NOT NULL element of the query. Code works for now without changes. 
Keep in mind in case it starts giving trouble.
3. Generate as many railguards as possible in parsing function; what happens if user forgets to close chord bracket (detect if there's a space and act upon that),
what happens if user uses 2 spaces in between two words of the lyrics, etc. FOR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS.
4. Have confirmation alert for deleting a song. 
5. Regarding visuals, in version.html page, the rating buttons are a little shifted to the right. Align them to rest of titles. 

CHECKPOINT:
- Everything regarding registration and auth works. 
- Everything regarding song creation, edition and revision (seeing the right contents) works. Versions have independent numbers in each song, but globally and 
under the hood, they have a UNIQUE id. 
- Chord parsing system. 
- Rating system complete. 

Next:



In base version, Hompage redirects to songs. When future improvements are made, Homepage will have enough elements to be displayed. 

After base version:
1. History feature.
2. Favorites feature.
